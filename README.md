#Jazz

##A simple script that makes using the Jasmine testing framework in a standalone project much simpler

###Installation

To install `jazz`, simply download (or clone) it, and put it somewhere in your path. Personally, I prefer `~/bin` (that's not in your path by default).

###Usage

`jazz init`                  - include jasmine in the project

`jazz create $FunctionName`  - creates ./src/FunctionName.js ./spec/FunctionNameSpec.js

`jazz run`                   - runs tests in browser
